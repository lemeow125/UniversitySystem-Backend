## University System Backend

This is a personal attempt to replicate most of the business functions required for a university backend system, providing a platform for the following:

- Enrollment
- Employee tracking (Including teacher/staff assignments)
- Student resources (Similar to Google Classroom)
- Student evaluation (Multiple Choice/Identification Quizzes)

The backend project is built in Django, with support for REST APIs
